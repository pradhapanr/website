Hi there! My name is Pradhapan, but I usually go by **Prad**.

I'm currently studying computer science at the University of Guelph. As a student in the co-op program, I had the opportunity
to intern at the following companies:
  - [ApplyBoard](https://www.applyboard.com/): *September 2021 - December 2021*
  - [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/): *May 2022 - August 2022*
  - [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/): *January 2023 - April 2023*
  - [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/): *May 2023 - August 2023*

Over this period, I worked on problems related to cloud engineering, infrastructure, and distributed systems. I also
have experience with full stack development using React. Check out my [resume](/assets/pdf/resume.pdf) for more info.

Occasionally, I find some time for my [personal projects](/projects). I'm currently building a distributed key/value store with
Raft ([MIT 6.824](http://nil.csail.mit.edu/6.824/2022/)).

Outside of engineering, you might find me playing competitive League of Legends (top 0.01% of players), or 
bluff shoving at a poker table.
